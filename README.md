## Music Theory: Coming Up With Musical Ideas Startinng With Nothing

### Film Music With Just Two Chords

**Making Film Music**

The easiest way that I've heard is from the professor Scott Murphy from the University oof Kansas and he has this idea that you can make most film music using just two chords.

You don't actually know much music theory at all uses and it's a very robust and quick way to get generating musical soundtracks

**Making Film Music With Just Two Chords**

What is a chord?
- Major
- Minor
- How to transition between two chords

Major chord: you have a tone that goes up 4 semitones to get a major third and then from there you go up 3 semitones

Minor chord: you have a tone that goes up 3 semitones to get a major third and then from there you go up 4 semitones

We've noticed that a lot of films use certain chord combinations repetitively and using this we've created a list

The distance between the first note, the tonic notes and the number of semitones

M5m

**Chord Associations**
- M2M: Protagonism (I -> II)
- M6M: Outer Space (I -> bV)
- M8M: Fantastical (I -> bVI)
- M4m: Sadness/Loss (I -> iii)
- M5m: Romantic/Middle Eastern (I -> iv)
- m5M: Wonder/Transcendence (also M7m) (I -> IV)
- m2M: Mistery or Dark Comedy (I -> II)
- m11M: Dramatic, Intense (I -> VII)
- m6m: Antagonism, danger (less character-based) (I -> bv)
- m8m: Antagonism, evil (more character-based) (I -> bvi)

So another thing that's woth mentioning is that these chords can be rearranged with inversions

So if I had a chord such as this major in G I can take any note of these three can I can move it up either eight whole notes higher or eight hole tones lower

Any note in a chord can be replaced/combined with a note that is a multiple of 8 whole tones higher or lower (an octave)
